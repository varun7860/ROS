# The history of ROS
Many robot frameworks exist, produced for a specific reason, for prototyping purposes. ROS was intended to be more general-purpose, although its designers do not believe it to be the ultimate OS able to do everything.

ROS is developed and maintained by a Californian company, Willow Garage, formed in 2006 by Scott Hassan, one of Google’s first employees who was involved in the development of search engine technology and who was also behind Yahoo! Groups (eGroups, in fact, which became Yahoo! Groups). The President and CEO of Willow Garage is Steeve Cousins, previously at IBM.

Willow Garage is a private company that maintains close links with Stanford University, which is not far from Willow Garage (in Palo Alto, California).

Willow Garage describes itself as a research laboratory and technology incubator for personal robotics, focused on research more than on profits (at the outset, at least).

Willow Garage develops both software with ROS and hardware with their PR2 and TurtleBot robots. Everything produced is open source (BSD licences). Their idea is that if we want to see robots reach our homes, then research needs to be accelerated by providing solid hardware and software bases that are open source.

It would appear that Willow Garage wishes to build the robotics community rather than robotics in and of itself. Interviewed by business magazine L’Expansion, Scott Hassan said that his objectives are the same as those of Irobot, but that the strategy to achieve them is different.

Four reasons to believe that Willow Garage will succeed according to the singularityhub.com website:

They want to provide resources to avoid reinventing the wheel, in order to speed up robotics research;
They have the necessary funds;
They have the attention of the research community;
They want to encourage the roll-out of their technology free of charge, before thinking of earning money.
